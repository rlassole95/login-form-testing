## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the **Cypress Login Form Testing** repository! This project showcases end-to-end testing for a login form using Cypress, a powerful testing framework that helps ensure your web application works as expected.

## 📦 Features

- **Comprehensive Test Cases**: Covers successful logins, invalid credentials, missing fields, and logout functionality.
- **Custom Commands**: Utilizes custom Cypress commands for streamlined login and message verification.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Integrates fixtures to manage test data efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - A powerful JavaScript end-to-end testing framework
- JavaScript - For scripting the test cases
- Fixtures - To manage test data

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cypress-login-testing.git

## 🏗️ Running the Tests

To execute the tests, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will launch the Cypress Test Runner. Select the `login.spec.cy.js` file to run the tests in an interactive mode.

To run tests in headless mode, use:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

## 📊 Test Cases

Here’s a brief overview of the test cases implemented:

1. **Successful Login**: Validates that users can log in with correct credentials.
2. **Invalid Login**: Tests the error message when incorrect credentials are provided.
3. **Missing Password**: Ensures the appropriate error message is displayed when the password is empty.
4. **Missing Username**: Verifies that an error message appears when the username is not provided.
5. **Successful Logout**: Confirms that users can successfully log out of the application.

## 📚 Future Enhancements

- Expand test coverage for other functionalities.
- Implement accessibility checks using `cypress-axe`.
- Optimize tests for better performance and maintainability.
